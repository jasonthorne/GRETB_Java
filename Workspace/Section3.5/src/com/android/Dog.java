	/*This class has no user defined constructor, so this uses the DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR. The default constructor is a hidden, no param constructor.
	 * In the case of this Dog class, it looks like this:
	 * 
	 * Dog(){
	 * 	super();
	 * }
	 * 
	 * When you create a constructor yourself, we no longer have access to the above default constructor.
	 * The default constructor means we can go:
	 * Dog spot=new Dog() and a Dog will be created, as the command 'new Dog' calls the default constructor
