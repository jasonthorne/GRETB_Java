 * Double and Integer
 * Wrapper classes are in built classes that "wrap" primitive variables in a 
 * class. Each primitive variable type has a corresponding wrapper class
 * an int has an Integer
 * byte has a Byte
 * short has a Short
 * long has a Long
 * float has a Float
 * char has a Character
 * boolean has a Boolean
 * A String is NOT A PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE, but an array of characters and
 * its "String" with a capital "S", there is no such thing as a "string"
 * data type
