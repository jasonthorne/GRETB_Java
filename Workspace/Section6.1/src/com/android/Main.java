	 * Benefit 1: With smaller derived classes (sub classes) we only need to concentrate on what is unique to a particular derived class.
	 * 
	 * Benefit 2: ease of modification to common properties & behaviour.
	 * 
	 * Benefit 3: Extensability. Code that works with the base class in some hierarchy tree can work with all classes that are added using inheritence later.
	 * 
	 * Benefit 4: Use tried & tested code from a base class. If something works in a base class. its going to work in a subclass. This promotes reuse of good code.
	 * I.e. connecting to a database finding a route in GPS software.
	 * 
	 * Benefit 5: You can concentrate on specialised behaviour.
	 * 
	 * Benefit 6: Logical structures & groupings.
